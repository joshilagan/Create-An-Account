# Create an Account Form

This form lets the user register to the website using his first and last name, email. Then prompts the user to create a password. The user must first read the terms and conditions then tick the I agree checkbox so that the user can click the submit button.

This is an improved version of the Register Form. Here, the syntax was lessened by using for of loop and call stacking

The Create an Account Form was built in Flexbox, Fontawesome and VanillaJS

**Features:**
- Upon clicking each input box, the outline changes its color. Then if you click outside of the input box, the outline color returns to normal.
- If you type in the password and confirm password input boxes, it will be masked with asterisk
- Confirm Password Box gets validated once you re-type the password there and click outside Confirm Password Box. An alert will appear if the password and confirm password input does not match
- The submit button is disabled if the user has not yet ticked the checkbox of "I understand the terms and conditions". Submit button work as soon as the checkbox is ticked.
- A sample terms and conditions document will appear when the "terms and conditions" link is clicked.
- A back button with a back icon from fontawesome was added in the terms and conditions page
